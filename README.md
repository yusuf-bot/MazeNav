## README: Maze Solver

**Introduction**

This Python project implements a maze-solving algorithm that can efficiently navigate through various maze configurations. The algorithm utilizes a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the maze and find the optimal path to the target.

**Installation**

To use this project, you'll need to have Python installed. You can also install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install colorama
```
*Note: The following library is only used for style purposes

**Usage**

1. **Prepare a Maze File:** Create a text file (e.g., `maze1.txt`) containing the maze description. Use the following format:

   ```
   XXXXXXXX
   S  X  X 
   X  X  X
   X    E
   ```

   - `X` represents walls.
   - ` ` represents empty paths.
   - `S` marks the starting position.
   - `E` marks the exit (target).

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python maze_solver.py maze1.txt
   ```

**Output**

The script will display the solved maze, with the path from the starting point to the exit marked with commas. If the maze is unsolvable, it will print an error message.

**Features**

- Efficient DFS algorithm for maze exploration.
- Clear and concise code structure with docstrings.
- Handles various maze configurations, including dead ends and multiple paths.
- Visualizes the solved maze with color-coded paths.

**Customization**

You can customize the maze description file to create different maze challenges. Experiment with different maze sizes, patterns, and obstacles to test the algorithm's capabilities.

**Additional Notes**

- The script assumes that the maze is solvable. If the maze contains dead ends or has no path to the exit, the algorithm will report an error.
- The script uses the `colorama` library for colored output. You may need to install it if it's not already present.
