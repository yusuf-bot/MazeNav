# MazeRunner

The project contains the AI agent, as well as two mazes, (one small, one big)

The AI agent runs using DFS, calculating distance on each step ensuring its making progress towards the target destination

The maze file contains a 'S' to indicate starting position, and 'E' to indicate end position
